Optick is a super-lightweight C++ profiler for Games.<br/>
Initial commit was: dd619c571c841349ebf0af0475ac0a427bd047f4

Gaijin uses Optick GUI as a simple start for Dagor profiler tool, as for now we don't open source in-game profiler independently from DagorEngine, but that will happen eventually.
Differences are too numerous to count, we don't expect profilers to converge back.
You can use this as a fontend profiler for Dagor-based apps.
